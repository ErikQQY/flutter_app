# flutter_app_test

A new and competitive Flutter application.

It is initially designed to become a calculator app, specified for the engineering students, capable of solving ODE, PDE, SDE and also support $\LaTeX$ output

I set many goals for different periods:

### Period 1
* Realize the basic calculating app features.
* Add the $\LaTeX$ support output features.
* Add the extra calculating features, such as exchange rate, calling transformation, Programmer mode.
### Period 2
* Add the plotting features
* Add the 3D plotting features
> maybe the three.js dart interface three.dart??

### Period 3
* Add the differential equations solver, which is capable of calculating ODE, PDE, SDE
* Add the linear algebra solver, introduce the NumPy function to this app
* Add the symbolic computing ability, introduce the SymPy functions to this app
* Add the complex computing
### Period 4
* Add the sudoku game, the app can generate the sudoku game
