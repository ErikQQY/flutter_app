# The initial implementation of the SuperCalculator

### The initial motivation of the app
As a enginnering students, we need to do a lot of computing tasks during our study. While the mobile phone become more and more common, so I came up an idea that we can make the most of the powerful computing power of the mobile phone and take advantages of mobile phone, portability and simplicity, to help users, especially the students, can compute complecatied formula more easily.

### Similiar comparison with current computing app
* Microsoft Math
	MS Math has an easy way for users to embark on, however, I personally think that it is desingned for primary students who only need the basic calculation(Besides, teenager maybe not allowed to use smart phone)
* Wolfram Alpha
	Wolfram Alpha indeed has a lot of resources and its various features impressed me alot, however, I think it's a bit utilitarian, if we need more features, we need to pay for it then these features would unblock.(And as for the GFW, emmmmmmm)
* Photomath 
* Sage Math

### The goal of the app
The goal of the app is to develop an app designed for university students and scientific researchers. It is also means that the SuperCalculator is capable of handling a lot of computing tasks, no matter the linear algebra, ODE, PDE, SDE, or 3D plotting, symbolic computing etc.

### One more thing
The aesthetics in the app is valued a lot. An app can't achieve its primary goal without elegant UI. I believe in the elegance and beautifulness.
